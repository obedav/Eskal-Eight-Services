1. Check webhook URL is accessible (use ngrok for local testing)
2. Verify API keys are correct
3. Check payment gateway dashboard for transaction status
4. Review backend error logs

### Webhook Not Received
1. Ensure webhook URL is HTTPS (required in production)
2. Verify signature verification is working
3. Check firewall/security rules
4. Test webhook manually using gateway dashboard

### Payment Verification Failed
1. Check transaction actually completed on gateway dashboard
2. Verify reference matches
3. Check API keys are for correct environment (test vs live)
4. Review gateway response in payment_gateway_response field
