## üöÄ How to View Your 3D Hero

### Option 1: If Dev Server is Already Running

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

3. You should see:
   - Loading animation with "Loading 3D Experience..."
   - Then the full 3D hero section will appear

### Option 2: If Dev Server is NOT Running

1. **Open terminal** in the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Wait for compilation** (usually 30-60 seconds)

3. **Browser will auto-open** to http://localhost:3000

## üì¶ What Was Installed

```json
{
  "@react-three/fiber": "^8.15.0",
  "@react-three/drei": "^9.88.0",
  "three": "latest"
}
```

**Bundle Size Impact:**

## üîß Customization Options

### Change Colors
In `Hero3D.jsx`, update color props:
```jsx
<ProductBox position={[-3, 2, -2]} color="#YOUR_COLOR" />
```

### Adjust Animation Speed
```jsx
<ProductBox rotationSpeed={1.2} /> // Higher = faster
```

### Add More Products
Copy any 3D element and change position:
```jsx
<ProductBox position={[x, y, z]} color="#color" scale={0.8} />
```

### Modify Camera
In `<Canvas>` component:
```jsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 8], fov: 50 }} />
